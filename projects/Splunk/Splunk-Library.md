# 👋 Welcome to My Splunk Detection Library

This section showcases a curated collection of Splunk queries I’ve developed during my time as a Security Analyst. Each query reflects real-world use cases across different domains such as authentication, endpoint activity, and email security. These detections were designed to support threat hunting, incident response, and proactive defense operations.
